Below one can find all the old code that is so old we decided to not clutter repositories with in

All A team stuff is in `/teama`, and B team stuff in `/teamb`

The `/shared` folder contains stuff like our old website

Turns out B team has all their code back to 2016, but A team never properly documented code so it is just starting spin up season.

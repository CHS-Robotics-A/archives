# 2019-2020-vex-tower-takeover
Code for team 1516B. For reliability, we're planning to move to Rust on top of PROS using the C++ bindgen. Optimally, we'll have a C (PROS friendly wrapper) which links with the seperately compiled Rust objects to avoid wrangling with PROS insistence on using the ugly single-platform GCC.

Another thing is PROS uses GCC but Clang is better is basically all aspects so hopefully PROS can be hacked to work with that.
